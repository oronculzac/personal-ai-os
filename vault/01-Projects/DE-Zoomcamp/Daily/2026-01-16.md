## 📝 Learning Today

### What I studied:
- Set up complete Obsidian + Linear integration system
- Configured MCP for knowledge management
- Created Skills & Cowork enhancements
- Built Data Engineering Zoomcamp workspace

### Key concepts:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-tool integration
- Obsidian as second brain / knowledge base
- Linear for project management
- Bidirectional sync between notes and tasks

## ✅ Tasks

## 💡 Insights & Reflections

### What clicked today:
- Having knowledge base (Obsidian) + task tracker (Linear) unified through MCP is powerful
- Vault integrated into antigravity_general workspace keeps everything together
- Skills & Cowork system now has 9 skills total!

### What's still confusing:


### Questions to explore:
- How to best structure daily notes vs module notes?
- When to create new vs update existing notes?
