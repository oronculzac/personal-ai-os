## 🔴 Critical Issues — ✅ ALL FIXED

1. ~~**API keys in plain JSON** (`mcp_config.json`)~~ → Created `.env` file
2. ~~**Nested `.agent/` in DE Zoomcamp**~~ → Renamed to `.agent_backup_duplicate`
3. ~~**Missing deployment script**~~ → Created `deploy.ps1`

---

## 🟡 Medium Issues — ✅ MOSTLY FIXED

4. **Skill duplication** — *Deferred: functional as-is*
5. ~~**No master requirements.txt**~~ → Created `.agent/requirements.txt`
6. **No proactive triggers** — *Deferred: research needed*

---

## 🟢 New Workflows Created

7. ~~**Project Onboarding**~~ → Created `onboard-project.md`
8. ~~**Morning Routine**~~ → Created `morning-routine.md`
9. **MCP Integration** — *Research item for future*

---

## 🟢 Enhancement Opportunities

7. **MCP Integration**
   - Model Context Protocol is 2025/2026 standard
   - Could standardize tool interfaces

8. **Project Onboarding**
   - No workflow to add new projects
   - Should create: folder, git, Linear, Obsidian

9. **Morning Routine**
   - User requested daily standup automation
   - Should pull Linear tasks + set priorities
