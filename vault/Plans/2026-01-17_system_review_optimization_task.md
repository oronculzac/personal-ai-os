- [x] Update all 6 workflows to use venv wrapper
- [ ] Update skill documentation to reference venv usage
- [ ] Test Python scripts work correctly with venv

### 2. Intuitive Artifact Naming & Obsidian Integration
- [x] Define naming convention for task/implementation artifacts
- [x] Create mechanism to copy artifacts to Obsidian with context names
- [ ] Update relevant workflows to auto-create Obsidian notes

### 3. Obsidian Vault Structure Optimization
